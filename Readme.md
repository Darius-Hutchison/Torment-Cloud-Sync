## Information

There is no cloud syncing capability with the GOG version and the developes have not added any. This is my simple implementation to add that functionality.

This script is a PowerShell script that creates a symlink to a selected folder to sync saves on multiple computers. The selected folder should be a locally synced cloud service of your choice e.g. \(OneDrive, Google Drive, Box, etc.\)

The release is just an exe complied from the script utilizing POSH tools.

Only Microsoft Windows is supported.
